ntro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/index.html) website design.

1.I like the spacing used on the Homepage. It doesn't feel too cluttered or to spaced out. There's a nice balance

2.I'm not a big fan of some of the section and headings. It's hard to scroll through a page and get a feel for what's being talked about without actually stopping to read

3.I like the side bar setup for navigating the site

4.The search icon at the top being placed and looking like the android system one in action and toolbars is cool. The animation when it opens is nice and crisp too.

5.I do wish the components section was broken down into different component types
